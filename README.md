üìä <b>HR Analytics Project: Understanding and Mitigating Employee Attrition<b>
<br> <br>
completed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis ) Project where I explored an Employee Attrition dataset using Python and its powerful data libraries!

Objective:
To understand the patterns behind employee attrition .

Key Insights:
‚úÖÔ∏è Younger employees had a higher attrition rate.
‚úÖÔ∏è Monthly income, Salary Slab and years at the company had strong influence on attrition.
‚úÖÔ∏è 0 - 5 Total Working year Employee had a most attrition among all. 
‚úÖÔ∏è Laboratory Technicians,  Sales Executive  and Sales Representative these job role had  huge attrition. 

Tools Used:
‚Ä¢ Python (Pandas, Numpy , Seaborn, Matplotlib)
‚Ä¢ Jupyter Notebook 

Skills Applied:
‚Ä¢ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing : Cleaned row data by removing columns which has most nulls and which are not in use.
Removed duplicates to maintain data inconsistency

‚Ä¢ GroupBy & Aggregation : Done some GroupBy operations to find total attrition in all age groups , job roles , department and more and plotted visuals using this .

‚Ä¢ Custom Visualizations (Bar plots, Heatmaps, Countplots)

‚Ä¢ Insight extraction from categorical and numerical data
