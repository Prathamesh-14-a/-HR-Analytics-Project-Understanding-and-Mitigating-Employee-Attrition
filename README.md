üìä <h2>HR Analytics Project: Understanding and Mitigating Employee Attrition</h2>
<br> <br>
completed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis ) Project where I explored an Employee Attrition dataset using Python and its powerful data libraries!
<br>
<h4>Objective:</h4><br>
To understand the patterns behind employee attrition .
<br>
<h4>Key Insights:</h4> <br>
‚úÖÔ∏è Younger employees had a higher attrition rate.<br>
‚úÖÔ∏è Monthly income, Salary Slab and years at the company had strong influence on attrition.<br>
‚úÖÔ∏è 0 - 5 Total Working year Employee had a most attrition among all. <br>
‚úÖÔ∏è Laboratory Technicians,  Sales Executive  and Sales Representative these job role had  huge attrition. 
<br>
<h4>Tools Used:</h4><br>
‚Ä¢ Python (Pandas, Numpy , Seaborn, Matplotlib)<br>
‚Ä¢ Jupyter Notebook 

<h4>Skills Applied:</h4><br>
‚Ä¢ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing : Cleaned row data by removing columns which has most nulls and which are not in use.<br> 
‚Ä¢ Removed duplicates to maintain data  inconsistency.<br>
‚Ä¢ GroupBy & Aggregation : Done some GroupBy operations to find total attrition in all age groups , job roles , department and more and plotted visuals using this .<br>

‚Ä¢ Custom Visualizations (Bar plots, Heatmaps, Countplots)<br>

‚Ä¢ Insight extraction from categorical and numerical data
